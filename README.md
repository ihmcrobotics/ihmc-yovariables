YoVariables provide a simple, convenient mechanism for storing and manipulating robot data.  While each
essentially contains a double value YoVariables are designed for integration into the SCS GUI.  Once registered,
a variable will automatically become available to the GUI for graphing, modification and other data manipulation.
Historical values of all registered YoVariables are stored in the DataBuffer which may be exported for later use.
